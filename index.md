## DeepAccess
We provide a code base for training and interpreting deep learning models for predicting cell type-specific accessibility. DeepAccess is available as a python package via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepaccess/) and [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/deepaccess) as well as a [binary](https://github.com/gifford-lab/deepaccess-package/releases) which includes the Python interpreter (only dependency is bedtools) and is available for Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.

## DeepAccess trained on mouse ATAC-seq
We train a DeepAccess model on ATAC-seq from 10 cell types available at this [zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/4908895#.YMOxzh0pCqB).
